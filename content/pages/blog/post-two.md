Securitisation is usually described either as something overly complex or as one of the main causes of the 2008 financial crisis. Both views are misleading.

At a basic level, securitisation is a way of transferring credit risk and managing balance sheets. It exists because banks face capital and liquidity constraints and cannot always hold every asset to maturity efficiently. When structured properly, it's a relatively straightforward financial tool.

The problem isn't securitisation itself, but how it has often been explained and, in some cases, used.

Securitisation allows a bank to transform a pool of relatively illiquid assets into securities with different risk profiles. This can be done for funding purposes, capital relief, or both. Investors take on defined portions of the credit risk in exchange for yield, while the originator reduces concentration and frees up balance sheet capacity.

Simple enough in theory. The confusion usually starts when people try to explain the mechanics.

One common source of confusion is the difference between cash and synthetic securitisation.

In a cash securitisation, the underlying assets are sold to a special purpose vehicle. The SPV issues notes to investors, and those investors are repaid from the actual cash flows generated by the assets. Credit risk is transferred through the sale of the assets themselves, subject to regulatory conditions. This is the most intuitive form of securitisation and the one most people are familiar with.

In a synthetic securitisation, the assets remain on the bank's balance sheet. Instead of selling the loans, the bank transfers credit risk using derivatives or guarantees. Investors provide credit protection and absorb losses if predefined credit events occur in the reference portfolio. These structures are typically used for capital relief rather than funding and rely heavily on modelling, portfolio data, and clearly defined loss mechanics.

Neither structure is inherently better. They serve different purposes and introduce different types of risk.

Another major misconception is the idea that securitisation itself caused the 2008 crisis. This is an oversimplification.

What failed was a combination of weak underwriting, misaligned incentives, excessive leverage, and a widespread reliance on assumptions that turned out to be wrong. In many cases, the underlying assets were poor quality, transparency was limited, and risk was transferred multiple times without a proper understanding of what was being transferred. Securitisation amplified these issues, but it didn't create them. Since the crisis, the market has changed significantly. Originators are required to retain risk, disclosure standards are higher, and structures are generally simpler and more conservative. The types of transactions commonly executed today look very different from those that existed pre-2008.

In practice, securitisation is less about complex structures and more about fundamentals.
Asset quality matters more than tranche design. Data quality matters more than modelling assumptions. Servicing and cash-flow timing matter more than headline ratings. Incentives matter, especially in stress scenarios.
Securitisation remains a central part of modern credit markets. It's neither a shortcut nor a relic. Like most financial tools, its effectiveness depends on how well the underlying risks are understood and managed.
